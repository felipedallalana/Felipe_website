Data on natural DON contamination of 15-16 hybrids and weather were collected from 10 Ohio locations over four years. Logistic regression with 10-fold cross-validation was used to develop models to predict the risk of DON ≥ 1 ppm. The presence and severity of GER predicted DON risk with an accuracy of 0.81 and 0.87, respectively. Temperature, relative humidity, surface wetness, and rainfall were used to generate 37 weather-based predictor variables summarized over each of six 15-day windows relative to maize silking (R1). With these variables, LASSO followed by all-subsets variable selection, and logistic regression with 10-fold cross-validation were used to build single-window weather-based models, from which 11 with one or two predictors were selected based on performance metrics and simplicity. LASSO-logistic regression was also used to build more complex multi-window models with up to 22 predictors. The performance of the best single-window models was comparable to that of the best multi-window models, with accuracy ranging from 0.81 to 0.83 for the former and 0.83 to 0.87 for the latter group of models. These results indicated that the risk of DON ≥ 1 ppm can be accurately predicted with relatively simple models built using temperature- and moisture-based predictors from a single window. These models will serve as the foundation for developing tools to predict the risk of DON contamination of maize grain.","tags":["Gibberella ear rot","Disease models","OSU","Field crops","Mycotoxin","PhD","Corn"],"title":"Logistic models derived using LASSO methods for quantifying the risk of natural contamination of maize grain with deoxynivalenol","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Felipe Dalla Lana","Laurence V Madden","Pierce A.

Deoxynivalenol (DON) was quantified in grain samples in all 4 years, whereas nivalenol, 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol, and 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol (15ADON) were quantified only in the last 2 years. Only DON and 15ADON were detected. The highest levels of GER and DON contamination were observed for 2018, followed by 2016 and 2017. No GER symptoms or DON were detected in 2015. Approximately 41% of the samples from asymptomatic ears had detectable levels of DON, and 7% of these samples from 2016 had DON  5 ppm. Associations between DON contamination and 43 variables representing summaries of temperature (T), relative humidity (RH), rainfall (R), surface wetness, and T-RH combinations for different window lengths and positions relative to R1 growth stage were quantified with Spearman correlation coefficients (r). Fifteen-day window lengths tended to show the highest correlations. Most of the variables based on T, R, RH, and T-RH were significantly correlated with DON for the 15-day window, as well as other windows. For moisture-related variables, there generally was a negative correlation before R1, changing to a positive correlation after R1. Results showed that GER and DON can be frequently found in Ohio maize fields, with the risk of DON being associated with multiple weather variables, particularly those representing combinations of T between 15 and 30°C and RH  80 summarized during the 3 weeks after R1","tags":["Gibberella ear rot","Disease models","OSU","Field crops","Mycotoxin","PhD","Corn"],"title":"Natural occurrence of maize Gibberella ear rot and contamination of grain with mycotoxins in association with weather variables","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Felipe Dalla Lana","Pierce A.

In each environment, one plot of each hybrid was planted and 10 ears per plot were inoculated via the silk channel. GER severity (proportion of ear area diseased) and DON contamination of grain (ppm) were quantified. Multiple rank-based methods, including Kendall’s concordance coefficient (W) and Piepho’s U, were used to quantify hybrid stability. The results found insufficient evidence to suggest crossover G × E interaction of ranks, with W greater than zero for GER (W = 0.28) and DON (W = 0.26), and U not statistically significant for either variable (P  0.20). Linear mixed models (LMMs) were also used to quantify hybrid stability, accounting for crossover or noncrossover G × E interaction of transformed observed data. Based on information criteria and likelihood ratio tests for GER and DON response variables, the models with more complex variance-covariance structures—heterogeneous compound symmetry and factor-analytic—provided a better fit than the model with the simpler compound symmetry structure, indicating that one or more hybrids differed in stability. Overall, hybrids were stable based on rank-based methods, which indicated a lack of crossover G × E interaction, but the LMMs identified a few hybrids that were sensitive to environment.

Here we present the current literature and gaps in knowledge of tar spot of corn in the Americas, its etiology, distribution, impact and known management strategies as a resource for understanding the pathosystem. This will in turn guide current and future research and aid in the development of effective management strategies for this disease.","tags":["Tar Spot","Corn","Disease models","OSU","Field crops"],"title":"Tar Spot - an understudied disease threatening corn production in the Americas","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nathan M.

[Phyllachorales - Phyllachoraceae]), is an emerging disease in the United States. In 2018 and 2019, significant but localized epidemics of tar spot occurred across the major corn producing region of the Midwest. After being first detected in 2015, tar spot was detected in 135 and 139 counties where the disease was not previously detected in 2018 and 2019, respectively, and is now established across 310 counties across the United Sates. Foliage with signs (stromata) of *P. maydis* and symptoms of tar spot were collected from 128 fields in 2018 and 191 fields in 2019, across seven states. Samples were assessed for severity of fungal stromata (percent leaf area covered with stromata) on foliage and the incidence of fisheye lesions (proportion of lesions with fisheye symptoms) associated with fungal stromata. Stromatal severity on samples in 2018 ranged from 0.5 to 67% and incidence of fisheye lesions ranged from 0 to 12%, whereas in 2019, stromatal severity ranged from 0.1 to 35% and incidence of fisheye lesions ranged from 0 to 80%, with 95% of samples presenting less than 6% incidence of fisheye lesions. Tar spot has spread substantially from where it was first reported in the United States.

BFR management relies on frequent fungicide applications. A meta-analysis was conducted on the outcomes from nine field trials to evaluate the efficacy and profitability of conventional and biological fungicides compared to a non-treated control (NTC). All trials were conducted in Florida between the 2005_06 and 2016_17 growing seasons. Fungicide treatments were applied weekly and plots were harvested twice a week for yield and BFR incidence quantification. Treatments were grouped into four categories= NTC, multi_site only (‘Thiram’), ‘Standard’ (captan alternated with fludioxonil + cyprodinil), and ‘Bacillus’. Following primary analyses, a random effects network meta_analytical model was fitted to estimate the mean yield and BFR incidence responses for each treatment group and to compare means between pairs of groups. The ‘Thiram’ and the ‘Standard’ treatment groups increased yield by 378.8 and 502.2 kg/ha/week, respectively, compared to the NTC. The yield difference between ‘Bacillus’ and NTC was not statistically significant. Besides increasing yield, ‘Thiram’ and ‘Standard’ also reduced BFR incidence by approximately 10 percentage points compared to the NTC. The mean yield responses and among_study variability from the meta_analysis were used to estimate the probability of a given yield response in a new future trial. The ‘Standard’ and ‘Thiram’ treatment groups showed higher estimated probabilities of increasing yield and resulting in a profitable return on application investments than the ‘Bacillus’ group of treatments. The results from this study provide growers with information that will aid their decision_making process regarding BFR management.","tags":["Strawberry","Meta-analysis","OSU","UFL","Profitability"],"title":"A Quantitative Synthesis of the Efficacy and Profitability of Conventional and Biological Fungicides for Botrytis Fruit Rot Management on Strawberry in Florida","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Felipe Dalla Lana"],"categories":[],"content":"from IPython.core.display import Image Image(\u0026#39;https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png\u0026#39;) print(\u0026#34;Welcome to Academic!\u0026#34;) Welcome to Academic!

However, because it is not always possible to treat fields at anthesis, studies were conducted to evaluate pre and postanthesis treatment options for managing FHB and DON in spring and winter wheat. Network meta_analytical models were fitted to data from 19 years of fungicide trials, and log response ratio (L) and approximate percent control (C) relative to a nontreated check were estimated as measures of the effects of six treatments on FHB index (IND= mean percentage of diseased spikelets per spike) and DON. The evaluated treatments consisted of either Caramba (metconazole) applied early (at heading [CE]), at anthesis (CA), or late (5 to 7 days after anthesis; CL), or Prosaro (prothioconazole + tebuconazole) applied at the same three times and referred to as PE, PA, and PL, respectively. All treatments reduced mean IND and DON relative to the nontreated check, but the magnitude of the effect varied with timing and wheat type. CA and PA resulted in the highest C values for IND, 52.2 and 51.5%, respectively, compared with 45.9% for CL, 41.3% for PL, and less than 33% for CE and PE. Anthesis and postanthesis treatments reduced mean IND by 14.9 to 29.7% relative to preanthesis treatments. The estimated effect size was also statistically significant for comparisons between CA and CL and PA and PL; CA reduced IND by 11.7% relative to CL, whereas PA reduced the disease by 17.4% relative to PL. Differences in efficacy against IND between pairs of prothioconazole + tebuconazole and metconazole treatments applied at the same timing (CE versus PE, CA versus PA, and CL versus PL) were not statistically significant. However, CA and CL outperformed PA and PL by 7 and 12.8%, respectively, in terms of efficacy against DON. All application programs had comparable efficacy against IND between spring and winter wheat types, but efficacy against DON was 10 to 16% greater for spring than winter wheat for applications made at or after anthesis. All programs led to an increase in mean grain yield and test weight relative to the nontreated check","tags":["Wheat","Meta-analysis","OSU","Field crops","Mycotoxin","DON"],"title":"Effects of Pre- and Postanthesis Applications of Demethylation Inhibitor Fungicides on Fusarium Head Blight and Deoxynivalenol in Spring and Winter Wheat.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Felipe Dalla Lana","Diane E.

The treatments were arranged under completely randomized block design with four replications, in a factorial design 2 x 3 x 3, utilizing two soybean cultivars, three spray nozzles and three chemical control programs. The fungicide applications were accomplished in R1 and R4 growth stages. Drop density, volumetric medium diameter (VMD), leaf area index (LAI), disease severity and grain yield were the variables measured. Based on the severity data of asian rust the area under disease progress curve (AUDPC) was calculated. The spray nozzles studied were significantly different in relation to drop deposition on soybean canopy, VMD, AUDPC and grain yield. The soybean grain yield was increased by 53.17% on Asgrow 8000 RG and 29.89% on Agiara RR cultivar, as a result of fungicide application. The LAI of cultivars influenced drop deposition and penetration into canopy.","tags":["Soybean","Aplication tecnology","UFSM","Undergrad"],"title":"Drop deposition on canopy and chemical control of Phakopsora pachyrhizi in soybeans (Portuguese)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ricardo Silveiro Balardin","Felipe Dalla Lana","Daniel Debona","Gerson Dalla Corte","Diego Dalla Favera","Nédio Rodrigo Tormen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"bbb994c175042f4bbb99dcf5087bed3c","permalink":"/publication/2011-cr-see-treatment/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2011-cr-see-treatment/","section":"publication","summary":"The objective of this research evaluated four seed treatments_ water (T1), carbendazim + thiram (T2), fipronil + thiophanate methyl + pyraclostrobin (T3) and abamectin + thiamethoxam + fludioxonil + mefenoxan + thiabendazole (T4) on growth parameters of soybean plants with or without low water availability. The experiments were conducted under field conditions and greenhouse. In the greenhouse, in treatments without low water availability, it was made four irrigations by day and in treatments with low water availability, it was made one irrigation each three days. In this trial, it was evaluated the plant height, root length, root volume, dry shoot weight, dry root weight, and foliar area. In the field trial, low water availability was established by the construction of low tunnels of polyethylene which prevented the water supply by irrigation and rain. In the field, it was also evaluated the plant height, the relative chlorophyll content, emergence, lesser cornstalk borer attack and grain yield. In both environments, the plants were kept on stress until 28th days after emergence. In the greenhouse, all the parameters were influenced by seed treatments with or without low water availability. In the field, the treatment with fipronil + thiophanate methyl + pyraclostrobin (T3) and abamectin + thiamethoxam + fludioxonil + mefenoxan + thiabendazole (T4) promoted higher plant height and relative chlorophyll content in both hydric schemes, higher emergence and grain yield in plants without and with lower water availability, respectively. It was concluded that seed treatment with these products promotes benefit changes in plant, increasing its tolerance to hydric stress, with a positive effect on soybean grain yield.","tags":["Soybean","Seed treatment","UFSM","Undergrad"],"title":"Seed treatment with fungicides and insecticides reducing the hydric stress on soybean plants (Portuguese)","type":"publication"}]
