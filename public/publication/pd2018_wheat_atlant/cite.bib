    abstract = { In mid-Atlantic soft-red winter wheat (SRWW) production, the standard timing for a fungicide application is between flag leaf emergence (Feekes growth stage [FGS] 8) and heading (FGS 10.5). However, two-pass and anthesis (FGS 10.5.1) applications are becoming common, although these programs have not been thoroughly evaluated for disease control, yield, and profitability. Experiments were conducted in the mid-Atlantic in 2015 and 2016 to evaluate fungicide programs with applications at FGS 8, FGS 10.5.1, and two-pass programs with an early application at green-up (FGS 5) followed by (FB) applications at either FGS 8 or FGS 10.5.1. Fungicide programs that included an application at FGS 10.5.1 resulted in the highest probability of no disease on the flag leaf (0.29 to 0.40). The estimated mean yield increases (D¯) relative to the nontreated check ranged from 253.65 to 634.16 kg ha−1. Using a grain price of \$0.18 kg−1 (\$5 bushel−1), probabilities were similar between applications at FGS 8 (0.49 to 0.56) and FGS 10.5.1 (0.53). The probability of profitability ranged from 0.48 to 0.57 for FGS 5 FB FGS 8 applications and 0.52 to 0.59 for FGS 5 FB FGS 10.5.1 applications, indicating limited benefit to two-pass programs. }
