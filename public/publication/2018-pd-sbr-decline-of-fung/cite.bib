    abstract = { An apparent decline of fungicide performance for the control of soybean rust in Brazil has been reported but the rate at which it has occurred has not been formally quantified. Control efficacy and yield response to three fungicides applied as single active ingredients (a.i.)—azoxystrobin (AZOX), cyproconazole (CYPR), and tebuconazole (TEBU)—and four applied as mixtures—AZOX+CYPR, picoxystrobin + CYPR, pyraclostrobin + epoxiconazole, and trifloxystrobin + prothioconazole (TRIF+PROT)—were summarized using network meta-analytic models fitted to mean severity and yield data from 250 trials (10-year period). The effect of year was tested on both variables in a meta-regression model. Overall control efficacy ranged from 56 to 84\%; the three single-a.i. fungicides performed the poorest (56 to 62\%). Yield increase for single-a.i. fungicides was as low as 30\% but ranged from 47 to 65\% for the premixes. Significant declines in both variables were detected for all fungicides except TRIF+PROT. For TEBU, control efficacy (yield response) declined the most: 78\% (18\%) to 54\% (8\%) from 2004–05 to 2013–14. The recent surge of resistant populations of Phakopsora pachyrhizi to both demethylation inhibitor and quinone outside inhibitor fungicides is likely the driving force behind a significant decline after 4 years of fungicide use. }
