I am a plant pathologist and epidemiologist with experience using data analysis to improve our understanding of disease epidemiology and disease management. I am currently working as a postdoctoral scholar at the Department of Plant Pathology and Environmental Microbiology of The Pennsylvania State University (PSU). I work in the laboratory of Dr. Paul D. Esker, collaborating closely with professors from other institutions, focus on the development of decision support tools for growers and agriculture agents. These tools will consider the risk and impact of multiple diseases occur, the efficacy of control methods, and the profitability that different production scenarios will provide a return on investment.

I have a Ph.D. and M.Sc. degree in Plant Pathology from The Ohio State University, where I work with Dr. Pierce A. Paul and Dr. Laurence V. Madden on the development of risk assessment models for Gibberella ear rot (*Fusarium gramearum*), a disease that causes yield and grain quality reduction, and mycotoxin contamination on maize (*Zea mays*). I also have an M.Sc. in Crop Sciences/Phytopathology, working on soybean rust (*Phakopsora pachyrhizi*), and B.S. in Agronomy. My research was published on several papers in peer-review journals, most on Phytopathology and Plant Disease. I have experience in teaching and extension.
