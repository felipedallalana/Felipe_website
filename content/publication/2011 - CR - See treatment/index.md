abstract: The objective of this research evaluated four seed treatments_ water (T1), carbendazim + thiram (T2), fipronil + thiophanate methyl + pyraclostrobin (T3) and abamectin + thiamethoxam + fludioxonil + mefenoxan + thiabendazole (T4) on growth parameters of soybean plants with or without low water availability. The experiments were conducted under field conditions and greenhouse. In the greenhouse, in treatments without low water availability, it was made four irrigations by day and in treatments with low water availability, it was made one irrigation each three days. In this trial, it was evaluated the plant height, root length, root volume, dry shoot weight, dry root weight, and foliar area. In the field trial, low water availability was established by the construction of low tunnels of polyethylene which prevented the water supply by irrigation and rain. In the field, it was also evaluated the plant height, the relative chlorophyll content, emergence, lesser cornstalk borer attack and grain yield. In both environments, the plants were kept on stress until 28th days after emergence. In the greenhouse, all the parameters were influenced by seed treatments with or without low water availability. In the field, the treatment with fipronil + thiophanate methyl + pyraclostrobin (T3) and abamectin + thiamethoxam + fludioxonil + mefenoxan + thiabendazole (T4) promoted higher plant height and relative chlorophyll content in both hydric schemes, higher emergence and grain yield in plants without and with lower water availability, respectively. It was concluded that seed treatment with these products promotes benefit changes in plant, increasing its tolerance to hydric stress, with a positive effect on soybean grain yield.
