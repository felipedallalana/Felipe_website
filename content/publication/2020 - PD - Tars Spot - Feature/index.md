abstract: Tar spot of corn has been a major foliar disease in several Latin American countries since 1904. In 2015, tar spot was first documented in the United States and has led to significant yield losses of approximately 4.5 million t. Tar spot is caused by an obligate pathogen, Phyllachora maydis, and thus requires a living host to grow and reproduce. Due to its obligate nature, biological and epidemiological studies are limited and impact of disease in corn production has been understudied. Here we present the current literature and gaps in knowledge of tar spot of corn in the Americas, its etiology, distribution, impact and known management strategies as a resource for understanding the pathosystem. This will in turn guide current and future research and aid in the development of effective management strategies for this disease.
