abstract: Botrytis fruit rot (BFR) is a major disease that affects strawberry production in Florida and worldwide. BFR management relies on frequent fungicide applications. A meta-analysis was conducted on the outcomes from nine field trials to evaluate the efficacy and profitability of conventional and biological fungicides compared to a non-treated control (NTC). All trials were conducted in Florida between the 2005_06 and 2016_17 growing seasons. Fungicide treatments were applied weekly and plots were harvested twice a week for yield and BFR incidence quantification. Treatments were grouped into four categories= NTC, multi_site only (‘Thiram’), ‘Standard’ (captan alternated with fludioxonil + cyprodinil), and ‘Bacillus’. Following primary analyses, a random effects network meta_analytical model was fitted to estimate the mean yield and BFR incidence responses for each treatment group and to compare means between pairs of groups. The ‘Thiram’ and the ‘Standard’ treatment groups increased yield by 378.8 and 502.2 kg/ha/week, respectively, compared to the NTC. The yield difference between ‘Bacillus’ and NTC was not statistically significant. Besides increasing yield, ‘Thiram’ and ‘Standard’ also reduced BFR incidence by approximately 10 percentage points compared to the NTC. The mean yield responses and among_study variability from the meta_analysis were used to estimate the probability of a given yield response in a new future trial. The ‘Standard’ and ‘Thiram’ treatment groups showed higher estimated probabilities of increasing yield and resulting in a profitable return on application investments than the ‘Bacillus’ group of treatments. The results from this study provide growers with information that will aid their decision_making process regarding BFR management.
