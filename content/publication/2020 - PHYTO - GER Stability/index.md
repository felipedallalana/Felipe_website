abstract: Trials were conducted to quantify the stability (or lack of G × E interaction) of 15 maize hybrids to Gibberella ear rot (GER; caused by *Fusarium graminearum*) and deoxynivalenol (DON) contamination of grain across 30 Ohio environments (3 years × 10 locations). In each environment, one plot of each hybrid was planted and 10 ears per plot were inoculated via the silk channel. GER severity (proportion of ear area diseased) and DON contamination of grain (ppm) were quantified. Multiple rank-based methods, including Kendall’s concordance coefficient (W) and Piepho’s U, were used to quantify hybrid stability. The results found insufficient evidence to suggest crossover G × E interaction of ranks, with W greater than zero for GER (W = 0.28) and DON (W = 0.26), and U not statistically significant for either variable (P > 0.20). Linear mixed models (LMMs) were also used to quantify hybrid stability, accounting for crossover or noncrossover G × E interaction of transformed observed data. Based on information criteria and likelihood ratio tests for GER and DON response variables, the models with more complex variance-covariance structures—heterogeneous compound symmetry and factor-analytic—provided a better fit than the model with the simpler compound symmetry structure, indicating that one or more hybrids differed in stability. Overall, hybrids were stable based on rank-based methods, which indicated a lack of crossover G × E interaction, but the LMMs identified a few hybrids that were sensitive to environment. Resistant hybrids were generally more stable than susceptible hybrids
